`sonner` is a very popular open-source library used to implement elegant and user-friendly **toast notifications** (brief pop-up messages such as success, error, warning notifications, etc.). It's an "opinionated" React component library, meaning it provides a set of default styles and behaviors while also allowing developers to customize according to their needs. Below is a detailed explanation of `sonner`, including its core concepts, usage methods, features, and practical application knowledge points.

---

### 1. What is `sonner`?
`sonner` is a toast notification component library designed specifically for React, developed by Emil Kowalski. It aims to provide a simple, intuitive way to display notifications in React applications. Compared to other similar libraries (such as `react-toastify`), `sonner` is characterized by:
- **Ready to use out of the box**: Beautiful default styles, smooth animations, usable without additional configuration.
- **Lightweight**: Small code size, excellent performance.
- **Clean API**: No need for complex contexts or hooks, just import and call.
- **Highly customizable**: Supports various notification types and custom styles.

Its core component is `<Toaster />`, used to render all toast notifications, while the `toast` function is the entry point for triggering notifications.

---

### 2. Installation and Basic Usage
To use `sonner` in a React project, you need to install it first. This can be done via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install sonner
# or
yarn add sonner
```

After installation, you need to import `<Toaster />` in your application's root component, and then use the `toast` function anywhere to trigger notifications. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { Toaster, toast } from 'sonner';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Toaster />
      <button onClick={() => toast('Hello, this is a toast!')}>
        Show Toast
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- `<Toaster />`: This is the container for notifications, responsible for rendering all toast messages. It's typically placed in the top-level component of your application.
- `toast('message')`: Calling this function displays a simple toast notification, by default shown in the bottom right corner of the screen.

After running this code, clicking the button will pop up a notification with "Hello, this is a toast!" with a default fade-in and fade-out animation.

### 3. Core Features and Key Points
`sonner` provides rich functionality. Here are its main features and how to use them:

#### 3.1 Notification Types
`sonner` supports multiple predefined notification types, suitable for different scenarios:
- **Default notification**: `toast('message')`
- **Success notification**: `toast.success('Operation successful')`
- **Error notification**: `toast.error('Something went wrong')`
- **Info notification**: `toast.info('This is a tip')`
- **Warning notification**: `toast.warning('Attention!')`
- **Loading state**: `toast.loading('Loading...')`

Example:
```jsx
<button onClick={() => toast.success('Task completed!')}>
  Show Success Toast
</button>
<button onClick={() => toast.error('Task failed!')}>
  Show Error Toast
</button>
```

Each type has default icons and colors (e.g., success is green, error is red), and these styles can be adjusted through configuration.

#### 3.2 Custom Options
The `toast` function accepts a second parameter, an object, to customize the behavior and appearance of notifications:
```jsx
toast('Event created', {
  description: 'April 7, 2025 at 7:00 PM', // Additional description
  duration: 5000, // Display duration (milliseconds), default is 4000
  position: 'top-center', // Position: top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right
  icon: <CustomIcon />, // Custom icon
  style: { background: '#f0f0f0' }, // Custom style
  className: 'my-toast', // Custom CSS class
});
```

#### 3.3 Promise Support
`sonner` provides a powerful `toast.promise` API for handling notification states of asynchronous operations. For example:
```jsx
toast.promise(
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data'), // Promise
  {
    loading: 'Loading data...',
    success: 'Data loaded successfully!',
    error: 'Failed to load, please try again.',
  }
);
```
When the Promise is in a pending state, it displays "Loading data...", on success it shows "Data loaded successfully!", and on failure it shows "Failed to load, please try again." This is particularly suitable for network requests or form submissions.

#### 3.4 Custom Components
You can create completely custom notification content using `toast.custom`:
```jsx
toast.custom((t) => (
  <div>
    <p>This is a custom notification</p>
    <button onClick={() => toast.dismiss(t)}>Close</button>
  </div>
));
```
Here, `t` is the toast ID, which can be used to manually close a specific notification.

#### 3.5 Global Configuration for `<Toaster />`
The `<Toaster />` component supports global configuration, affecting the behavior of all toasts:
```jsx
<Toaster
  position="top-right" // Default position
  theme="dark" // Theme: light, dark, system
  richColors // Enable more vibrant colors
  expand={true} // Expand all notifications by default
  visibleToasts={3} // Number of notifications visible at once
  closeButton // Show close button
  toastOptions={{
    style: { fontFamily: 'Arial' }, // Global style
  }}
/>
```

---

### 4. Advanced Usage
#### 4.1 Manually Closing Notifications
Each toast has a unique ID that can be used to close it manually:
```jsx
const toastId = toast('This is a notification');
toast.dismiss(toastId); // Close a specific notification
toast.dismiss(); // Close all notifications
```

#### 4.2 Action Buttons
You can add interactive buttons to notifications:
```jsx
toast('File saved', {
  action: {
    label: 'Undo',
    onClick: () => console.log('Undo operation'),
  },
});
```

#### 4.3 Stacking Effect
When multiple notifications appear simultaneously, `sonner` automatically stacks them and displays them with animation. You can control the number of visible notifications using the `visibleToasts` property, or set `expand={false}` to limit stacking.

#### 4.4 Swipe to Dismiss
`sonner` supports swipe-to-dismiss animations by default. Users can close notifications by swiping with a mouse or touch, with no additional configuration required.

### 5. Advantages and Use Cases
#### Advantages:
- **Simple to use**: No need for complex contexts or state management.
- **Attractive defaults**: Modern default styles and animations.
- **Flexibility**: Supports everything from simple messages to complex custom components.
- **Excellent performance**: Lightweight with smooth animations.

#### Use Cases:
- Form submission feedback (success/failure).
- Network request status indicators.
- User action confirmations (e.g., "Added to cart").
- Real-time event notifications (e.g., new message alerts).

---

### 6. Important Notes
- **Server Component Compatibility**: In frameworks like Next.js, `<Toaster />` can be placed in server components, but the `toast` function needs to be called on the client side (i.e., with the `use client` directive).
- **Initial Rendering Issues**: If you need to display a notification when a component mounts, it's recommended to wrap the `toast` call in a `setTimeout` to avoid hydration issues:
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => toast('Welcome back!'), 0);
  }, []);
  ```

---

### 7. Summary
`sonner` is a powerful and easy-to-use React toast notification library. Its core consists of the `<Toaster />` component and the `toast` function, providing rich functionality through a clean API, including various notification types, Promise support, custom styles, and interactivity. Whether you want to quickly add notification features or need a highly customized notification system, `sonner` is worth trying.
