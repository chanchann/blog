### Web Server and Reverse Proxy
Nginx can directly serve static files (such as HTML, CSS) and also act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to your web service (such as an application running on port 8080).

#### Configuration Files
The main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, but you'll more often use site configurations in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.

#### Event-Driven Model
You don't need to understand it deeply, but knowing that Nginx can efficiently handle a large number of concurrent requests is enough.

### Installation and Basic Operations

#### Installation
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx`
- CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install nginx`
- Check version: `nginx -v`

#### Common Commands
- Start: `sudo systemctl start nginx`
- Restart: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
- Test configuration: `nginx -t` (very important to avoid configuration errors)
- Reload configuration (without service interruption): `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
- Stop: `sudo systemctl stop nginx`

### Configuration File Basics

#### Structure
The configuration consists of "blocks" enclosed in `{}`, such as `server {}`, `location {}`.

#### Common Directives
- `listen`: The port to listen on (e.g., `listen 80;`)
- `server_name`: Domain name or IP (e.g., `server_name example.com;`)
- `proxy_pass`: Forward requests to the backend (e.g., `proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;`)
- `root` and `index`: If directly serving static files, specify the file path and default homepage

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

This is the feature you'll need most right now. Assuming your web service is running on localhost:8080, the configuration is as follows:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

This will forward requests from the external network to your service.

### Basic Traffic Control

#### Request Rate Limiting

Example:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        limit_req zone=mylimit burst=5;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

Meaning: Each IP can make at most 1 request per second, with bursts of up to 5 requests allowed.

#### Blacklist

Example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    deny 192.168.1.100; # Block specific IP
    allow all;          # Allow all others
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

### Logging and Debugging

#### Default Log Paths
- Access log: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- Error log: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
- Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log` (real-time error viewing)

## Steps for Beginners Using Nginx

### 1. Install and Start
After installation, access your server's IP. If you see the "Welcome to nginx!" page, it means it's running properly.

### 2. Create a Simple Reverse Proxy
Create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` (e.g., myapp):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-ip-or-domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

### 3. Enable Configuration
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t # Check configuration is correct before
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 4. Test Access
Use a browser or curl to access your server's IP and ensure you can see the content of your web service.

### 5. Gradually Add Features
- Need HTTPS? Configure SSL with Certbot
- Need a blacklist? Add deny directives
- Need rate limiting? Add limit_req

## Key Focus Areas for New Developers

1. **Learn the Basics First**: Reverse proxy, port listening, simple location routing
2. **Expand as Needed**: Learn load balancing when traffic increases, SSL and firewall when security requirements are high
3. **Utilize Tools**:
   - Online configuration generators (like nginxconfig.io) can quickly generate configuration files
   - Official documentation (nginx.org) and community tutorials are practical
4. **Common Problem Solutions**:
   - 502 error: Backend service not running or wrong address
   - 403/404: Permission or path issues, check logs
   - Configuration not taking effect: Forgot to reload

## Learning Suggestions

- **Goal-Oriented**: Focus first on your needs (exposing services, blacklisting), don't start with complex features
- **Practice-Based**: Set up an environment on your local machine or cloud server, try changing configurations to see effects
- **Step by Step**:
  1. First step: Get reverse proxy working
  2. Second step: Add a blacklist or rate limiting
  3. Third step: Configure HTTPS (using free Let's Encrypt certificates)

## Summary

For new developers, you need to master:
- Installing Nginx and basic commands
- Simple reverse proxy configuration (proxy_pass)
- Basic traffic control (limit_req, deny)
- Log viewing and troubleshooting
