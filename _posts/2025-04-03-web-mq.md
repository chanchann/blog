While directly subscribing to backend message queues (MQ, such as RabbitMQ, Kafka) from the frontend might seem like an intuitive solution for receiving messages, this approach is rarely used in mainstream real-time data push solutions. The reasons involve multiple aspects including technical implementation, architectural design, security, performance, and actual Web application requirements.

---

### 1. Technical Implementation Limitations
#### 1.1 Browser Environment Constraints
- **Protocol Support**:
  - Message queues (like RabbitMQ, Kafka) typically use specific protocols, such as AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) for RabbitMQ and custom TCP protocol for Kafka.
  - Browser environments (JavaScript) primarily support HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, and SSE protocols, and **do not natively support AMQP or Kafka protocols**. Direct MQ subscription from frontend requires additional client libraries, which are usually designed for backend use (like AMQP clients for Go, Java, Python).
  - Even with JavaScript AMQP clients (e.g., through WebSocket bridging to RabbitMQ), additional configuration and dependencies are required, increasing complexity.
- **Connection Limitations**:
  - Browsers limit concurrent connections (usually max 6 HTTP connections per domain), and MQ connections being persistent would occupy valuable connection resources.
  - Browser environments are not suitable for handling complex connection management and reconnection logic, which MQ clients typically need to implement.

#### 1.2 Client Library Compatibility
- **Frontend Unsuitability for Direct MQ Client Usage**:
  - MQ client libraries (like `amqp` for RabbitMQ, `kafkajs` for Kafka) are designed for backend environments, depending on Node.js or similar runtime environments.
  - Running these libraries in browsers requires WebSocket bridging (like RabbitMQ's Web STOMP or Web MQTT plugins), which essentially still accesses MQ indirectly through WebSocket protocol.
  - Directly including MQ client libraries in frontend increases code complexity and bundle size, contradicting modern Web development's "lightweight frontend" principle.

### 2. Security and Permission Control
#### 2.1 Exposing MQ Access Credentials
- **Security Risks**:
  - Direct MQ subscription from frontend requires exposing MQ connection details (host address, port, username, password) to browsers, creating a major security vulnerability.
  - Attackers can easily obtain these credentials through developer tools, potentially leading to data leaks, message tampering, or service abuse.
- **Complex Permission Management**:
  - MQ permission management (like RabbitMQ's vhost, user permissions) is backend-oriented, making it difficult to implement fine-grained frontend user access control.
  - Creating individual MQ user accounts for each frontend user would be administratively burdensome; sharing one account among all users prevents proper user data isolation.

#### 2.2 Data Filtering and Business Logic
- **Unable to Directly Handle Business Logic**:
  - MQ messages are typically raw data (e.g., JSON-formatted news data). Frontend directly subscribing to MQ requires client-side message parsing and processing.
  - Many business logic operations (filtering, sorting, permission verification, data formatting) should be handled by backend. Moving these to frontend increases complexity and blurs frontend-backend responsibilities.
- **Data Isolation**:
  - Different users may need to see different news (e.g., filtered by user preferences). Direct MQ subscription makes personalized pushing difficult, as MQ typically broadcasts messages to all subscribers.

---

### 3. Performance and Scalability Issues
#### 3.1 Connection Management
- **MQ Connection Overhead**:
  - MQs are designed for high throughput between backend services, not for direct frontend user connections.
  - Having each frontend user directly connect to MQ requires managing thousands of persistent connections, significantly increasing MQ load. MQ connection management mechanisms (like RabbitMQ's Erlang processes) aren't optimized for large-scale client connections.
- **Comparison with WebSocket/SSE**:
  - WebSocket and SSE are specifically designed for Web environments, allowing servers to efficiently manage numerous client connections (e.g., through Nginx reverse proxy, load balancing).
  - WebSocket/SSE connections are managed by backend HTTP servers, which can distribute messages from MQ to frontend as needed, keeping MQ handling only backend connections.

#### 3.2 Message Distribution Efficiency
- **MQ Distribution Mechanism**:
  - MQs typically use queue or topic-based broadcast mechanisms, delivering messages to all subscribers.
  - With direct frontend MQ subscription, messages are pushed to all users even if irrelevant (e.g., users interested in DOGE news receiving SHIB news).
  - Backend pushing through WebSocket/SSE can filter messages based on business logic (e.g., user-subscribed cryptocurrencies), only pushing relevant data.
- **Flow Control**:
  - MQs lack built-in flow control mechanisms suitable for frontend. High message generation rates could overwhelm frontend, causing page lag.
  - WebSocket/SSE allows backend control of push rates (e.g., batch pushing, rate limiting), better protecting frontend performance.

#### 3.3 Scalability
- **MQ Scaling**:
  - MQs suit backend service message passing but not direct frontend user interaction. User surge requires MQ scaling, which is costly (adding nodes, adjusting partitions).
  - With WebSocket/SSE, MQ handles only backend communication, while backend HTTP servers can easily scale (e.g., adding instances through load balancing), better suiting Web application scaling needs.

### 4. Why Mainstream Solutions Choose WebSocket/SSE
#### 4.1 Web Environment Compatibility
- WebSocket and SSE are Web-specific protocols with native browser support (`WebSocket` API and `EventSource` API), requiring no additional client libraries.
- They're based on HTTP/HTTPS, naturally supporting Web standards like CORS and SSL encryption, facilitating development and debugging.

#### 4.2 Middleware Layer Benefits
- **Backend as Middleware**:
  - In mainstream solutions, backend (HTTP server) acts as middleware between MQ and frontend, reading MQ messages, processing business logic (filtering, sorting, formatting), then pushing via WebSocket/SSE.
  - This architecture provides:
    1. **Security**: MQ credentials remain backend-only, preventing direct frontend access.
    2. **Business Logic**: Backend can filter messages based on user needs (e.g., pushing only subscribed cryptocurrencies).
    3. **Performance Optimization**: Backend can control push rates, batch messages, reducing frontend load.
    4. **Scalability**: Backend easily scales (e.g., through Nginx load balancing), MQ handles few backend connections.

#### 4.3 Development and Maintenance Costs
- WebSocket/SSE implementation and maintenance costs are low, with mature library support in Go (e.g., `gorilla/websocket`).
- Direct frontend MQ subscription requires additional bridging services (like RabbitMQ's Web STOMP plugin), increasing development and operational complexity.

### 5. Recommended Architecture (Backend Relay)
Based on above analysis, recommended architecture:
1. **MQ -> Backend**:
   - Backend receives new news via MQ (RabbitMQ, Kafka), stores in database.
2. **Backend -> Frontend**:
   - Backend pushes new news to frontend via WebSocket or SSE.
   - Backend can filter messages based on business logic (e.g., user-subscribed cryptocurrencies).
3. **Frontend**:
   - Frontend receives messages via WebSocket/SSE, dynamically updates page.

### 6. Summary
Direct frontend MQ subscription is inadvisable due to:
1. **Technical Limitations**: Browsers lack native AMQP/Kafka protocol support, requiring complex bridging.
2. **Security Issues**: Exposing MQ credentials to frontend creates security risks.
3. **Performance Issues**: MQ isn't designed for numerous frontend connections, risking performance bottlenecks.
4. **Functional Limitations**: Direct frontend MQ subscription complicates business logic implementation (filtering, access control).

Mainstream solutions (WebSocket/SSE) resolve these issues through backend relay:
- Backend reads MQ messages, processes business logic, pushes via WebSocket/SSE to frontend.
- This approach is secure, flexible, performant, and aligns with Web development architectural principles.
