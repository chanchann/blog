Using Nginx to expose your web services to the internet is a mainstream and sensible approach. As a high-performance web server and reverse proxy, Nginx offers significant advantages in traffic control, load balancing, security, and performance optimization. Here are some reasons and analysis explaining why this is the right choice, along with some considerations:

## Why is Using Nginx Mainstream and Correct?

### Traffic Control:
- Nginx provides flexible configuration options to limit request rates (limit_req) and concurrent connections (limit_conn), effectively preventing DDoS attacks or overloads.
- You can block malicious traffic by configuring blacklists (such as IP-based access control).

### Load Balancing:
- Nginx has built-in support for various load balancing strategies (round-robin, least connections, IP hash, etc.), which can distribute traffic to multiple backend service instances, improving system scalability and reliability.
- If your web service needs horizontal scaling in the future, Nginx can support this architecture well.

### High Performance and Low Resource Usage:
- Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven model that can handle a large number of concurrent requests while using relatively little memory and CPU, making it suitable as an internet-facing entry point.

### Security:
- You can configure SSL/TLS in Nginx to support HTTPS, ensuring encrypted data transmission.
- Nginx can enhance security by setting appropriate headers (such as X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) or blocking sensitive requests.

### Easy Configuration and Maintenance:
- Nginx's configuration files are simple and intuitive, with rich community resources, making it easy to get started and debug.

### Widespread Use:
- Nginx is one of the most popular web servers (consistently ranking at the top in market share), used by numerous enterprises in production environments (such as Netflix, Cloudflare, etc.), with thoroughly proven stability.

## Is This the "Best" Practice?

This depends on your specific requirements, but overall, Nginx is a very universal solution. If your web service only needs simple exposure to the internet without complex traffic management requirements, you might get by using the service's own port (such as port 5000 for Python Flask). However, looking long-term, adding Nginx can bring these benefits:

- **Decoupling**: Your web service focuses on business logic, while Nginx handles network layer complexities.
- **Flexibility**: If you need to replace backend services or add clusters in the future, you can just adjust the Nginx configuration without changing code.
- **Observability**: Nginx's logging functionality can help you monitor traffic and troubleshoot issues.

## Important Considerations

### Configuration Complexity:
- If you're unfamiliar with Nginx, initial configuration might have a learning curve, especially when dealing with HTTPS, load balancing, or complex rewrite rules. It's recommended to start with simple configurations and optimize gradually.

### Single Point of Failure:
- Nginx itself can become a single point of failure. For high traffic scenarios, consider deploying multiple Nginx instances and using DNS round-robin or external load balancers (such as those provided by cloud services).

### Performance Bottlenecks:
- Default configurations may not be suitable for your specific scenario. Parameters (such as worker_processes, worker_connections) should be adjusted based on traffic and hardware.

### Security Details:
- Ensure Nginx is regularly updated to the latest version to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- Configure firewalls (such as ufw or cloud service security groups) to only open necessary ports (such as 80 and 443).

### Integration with Existing Services:
- If your web service already has built-in reverse proxy or load balancing functionality (such as using Docker with Traefik), you'll need to evaluate whether using Nginx would be redundant.

## Simple Example Configuration

Assuming your web service runs on localhost:8080, here's a basic Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-service):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com; # Replace with your domain or public IP

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    # Limit requests per second
    limit_req zone=one burst=5;

    # Blacklist example
    deny 192.168.1.100; # Replace with the IP you want to block
}

# Define rate limiting zone
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;
```

After enabling the configuration, run `nginx -t` to test the syntax, then restart Nginx (`systemctl restart nginx`).

## Conclusion

Using Nginx to expose web services is a mainstream and recommended practice, especially when you need traffic control, blacklist management, load balancing, and other features. It not only enhances the stability and security of your service but also lays the foundation for future expansion. It's completely worthwhile if you're willing to spend some time learning its configuration.
