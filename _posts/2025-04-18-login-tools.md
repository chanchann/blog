To implement a login system in a React and TypeScript application with Google and Apple authentication (and potentially other mainstream providers), you have several third-party tools and libraries that can simplify the process, reduce maintenance overhead, and provide robust security.

### Recommended Third-Party Tools

1. **Auth0**
   - **Description**: Auth0 is a comprehensive identity management platform that supports social logins (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.), single sign-on (SSO), and custom authentication flows. It integrates well with React and TypeScript via the `@auth0/auth0-react` SDK.
   - **Pros**:
     - Easy integration with Google and Apple sign-in using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0.
     - Provides a secure, scalable solution with features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and user management.
     - TypeScript support with well-typed SDKs.
     - Handles token management (JWTs) and session persistence securely.
     - Extensive documentation and community support.[](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)
   - **Cons**:
     - Can be costly for high user volumes (check pricing at https://auth0.com/pricing).
     - Some advanced customizations may require deeper understanding of the platform.
   - **Setup**: Use the `Auth0Provider` component to wrap your React app and configure Google/Apple providers in the Auth0 dashboard.[](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)

2. **Firebase Authentication**
   - **Description**: Firebase Authentication, part of Google’s Firebase platform, supports Google, Apple, and other social logins out of the box. It’s lightweight and integrates seamlessly with React using the `firebase` SDK.
   - **Pros**:
     - Native support for Google Sign-In and Sign in with Apple (via OAuth 2.0).[](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/apple)
     - Easy to set up with minimal backend configuration.
     - Free tier is generous for small to medium apps.
     - TypeScript-friendly with official type definitions.
     - Integrates with other Firebase services (e.g., Firestore, Cloud Functions) for a full-stack solution.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited customization compared to Auth0.
     - Tied to Google’s ecosystem, which may be a concern for some.
   - **Setup**: Configure Google and Apple providers in the Firebase Console, then use the Firebase SDK in your React app to handle authentication flows.[](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/apple)[](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-login-with-react-native-and-firebase/)

3. **Clerk**
   - **Description**: Clerk is a modern authentication and user management platform designed for React applications. It supports social logins (Google, Apple, etc.) and provides pre-built UI components.
   - **Pros**:
     - Developer-friendly with React-specific hooks and components.
     - Strong TypeScript support.
     - Customizable UI for login flows, reducing frontend work.
     - Handles session management and JWTs securely.

     - TypeScript SDK available for React integration.
     - Suitable for self-hosted, privacy-focused applications.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires significant setup and maintenance compared to managed solutions.
     - Steeper learning curve for complex configurations.
   - **Setup**: Deploy Kratos locally or use a managed instance, then integrate with React using the Ory SDK.[](https://www.ory.sh/blog/login-react-native-authentication-example-api)

### Libraries for Manual Integration
If you prefer to handle authentication yourself but want libraries to simplify social login integration, consider these:

- **react-google-login** / **@react-oauth/google**
  - For Google Sign-In, the `@react-oauth/google` package is a modern, TypeScript-compatible library to handle Google OAuth 2.0 flows. You’ll need to set up a Google Cloud project and obtain a client ID.[](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login)[](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-adding-google-login-react-app/)
  - Example:
    ```tsx
    import { GoogleOAuthProvider, GoogleLogin } from '@react-oauth/google';

    const App = () => (
      <GoogleOAuthProvider clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID">
        <GoogleLogin
          onSuccess={(credentialResponse) => {
            console.log(credentialResponse);
          }}
          onError={() => {
            console.log('Login Failed');
          }}
        />
      </GoogleOAuthProvider>
    );
    ```

- **react-native-apple-authentication** (for React Native, but adaptable for web)
  - For Apple Sign-In, you can use libraries like `apple-signin-auth` for Node.js backends or Apple’s JS SDK for web. These require configuring Sign In with Apple in the Apple Developer Console.[](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication)[](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth)
  - Example (web with Apple JS SDK):
    ```tsx
    import Script from 'next/script';

    const AppleLogin = () => {
      return (
        <>
          <Script
            src="https://appleid.cdn-apple.com/appleauth/static/jsapi/appleid/1/en_US/appleid.auth.js"
            onLoad={() => {
              window.AppleID.auth.init({
                clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                scope: 'name email',
                redirectURI: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI',
              });
            }}
          />
          <div id="appleid-signin" data-color="black" data-border="true" data-type="sign in" />
        </>
      );
    };
    ```

### Recommendations
- **For Simplicity and Speed**: Use **Firebase Authentication** if you want a quick setup with minimal maintenance and are comfortable with Google’s ecosystem. It’s ideal for small to medium projects.[](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/apple)
- **For Scalability and Features**: Choose **Auth0** if you need a robust, enterprise-grade solution with extensive customization and support for multiple providers. It’s great for larger apps or teams.[](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)
- **For Developer Experience**: Try **Clerk** if you want a modern, React-focused solution with pre-built components and TypeScript support. It’s perfect for startups or solo developers.[](https://clerk.com/blog/building-a-react-login-page-template)
- **For Full Control**: Use **Supabase** or **Ory Kratos** if you prefer open-source solutions and are willing to manage your own infrastructure. These are best for privacy-conscious or custom projects.[](https://www.ory.sh/blog/login-react-native-authentication-example-api)
- **For Manual Integration**: Combine libraries like `@react-oauth/google` and `apple-signin-auth` with a custom backend (e.g., Express with Passport.js) if you want lightweight dependencies but are comfortable handling token verification and security.[](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-adding-google-login-react-app/)[](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-signin-auth)

### Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Always store tokens securely (avoid localStorage due to XSS risks) and use HTTPS. Managed solutions like Auth0 and Clerk handle much of this for you.[](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/)
- **Apple Requirements**: If your app uses Google or other social logins and targets iOS, Apple mandates including Sign in with Apple. Ensure compliance to avoid App Store rejection.[](https://www.oneclickitsolution.com/blog/integrate-sign-in-with-apple-id)
- **TypeScript**: All recommended tools have strong TypeScript support, but verify type definitions for libraries like `react-google-login` if you go the manual route.
- **Backend**: For manual integrations, you’ll need a backend to verify tokens (e.g., Node.js with `jsonwebtoken` for Apple or Google’s token verification APIs). Managed solutions like Firebase and Auth0 reduce this need.
