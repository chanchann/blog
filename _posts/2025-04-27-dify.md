Dify is an LLM application development platform that integrates **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** and **LLMOps** principles to streamline the creation of generative AI applications. Its name, derived from "Define + Modify," reflects its focus on enabling users to define and iteratively improve AI applications. Key highlights include:

- **Open-Source Nature**: Dify is freely available under a permissive license, with its source code hosted on GitHub (`langgenius/dify`). This allows for self-hosting, customization, and community contributions.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)[](https://docs.dify.ai)
- **No-Code/Low-Code Approach**: It provides a visual interface for building AI applications, making it accessible to non-developers while offering APIs and customization for developers.[](https://nocodestartup.io/en/dify/)[](https://www.udemy.com/course/dify-ai-en/)
- **Model Neutrality**: Supports integration with a wide range of LLMs, both commercial (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT series, Anthropic’s Claude) and open-source (e.g., Llama2, Mistral), as well as self-hosted models.[](https://huggingface.co/Dify-AI)
- **Comprehensive Tech Stack**: Combines AI workflow orchestration, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, agent capabilities, model management, and observability features to enable production-ready applications.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)

### 2. Core Features
Dify offers a robust set of tools and functionalities to support the development of AI-native applications. Here are the main features:

#### a. Visual Workflow Orchestration
- **Canvas-Based Design**: Users can design AI workflows and applications using a drag-and-drop visual interface, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**: Dify supports CoT reasoning, enabling AI agents to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, mimicking human problem-solving. For example, to answer a query like “How old is Melania Trump?”, the agent might use tools like Wikipedia search and current time calculation to derive the answer.[](https://dify.ai/blog/dify-ai-unveils-ai-agent-creating-gpts-and-assistants-with-various-llms)
- **Structured Output**: LLM nodes can return organized, API-friendly data, simplifying integration with other systems.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/releases)

#### b. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
- **Built-In RAG Engine**: Dify includes a powerful RAG system that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases, documents, or web sources.[](https://huggingface.co/Dify-AI)
- **Parent-Child Retrieval**: Introduced in version 0.15.0, this feature improves RAG accuracy by matching queries with smaller “child” chunks of data while providing broader context from larger “parent” chunks.[](https://dify.ai/blog)
- **Document Support**: Supports ingestion of various formats (e.g., PDFs, PPTs) and integrates with external data sources like Notion or web pages.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)[](https://www.udemy.com/course/dify-ai-en/)
- **Metadata Filtering**: Version 1.1.0 introduced metadata-based filtering to enhance RAG precision and security by controlling data access.[](https://dify.ai/blog)

#### c. AI Agent Capabilities
- **Custom Agents**: Users can create intelligent agents that autonomously perform complex tasks by combining LLMs with tools and knowledge bases.[](https://dify.ai/blog/dify-ai-unveils-ai-agent-creating-gpts-and-assistants-with-various-llms)
- **Function Calling and ReAct**: Supports advanced reasoning methods like Function Calling (used by models from OpenAI, ChatGLM, etc.) and ReAct for models lacking this capability, ensuring broad compatibility.[](https://dify.ai/blog/dify-ai-unveils-ai-agent-creating-gpts-and-assistants-with-various-llms)
- **Tool Integration**: Offers over 50 built-in tools (e.g., Google Search, Stable Diffusion, WolframAlpha) and supports custom tools via OpenAPI/Swagger or OpenAI Plugin specifications.[](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/tools)[](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/dify)

#### d. Model Management
- **Broad Model Support**: Integrates with hundreds of LLMs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Azure, Replicate, and self-hosted solutions. Users can compare model performance side-by-side.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)[](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-t22mebxzwjhu6)
- **Prompt IDE**: A user-friendly interface for crafting, testing, and optimizing prompts, with features like text-to-speech integration for chat-based apps.[](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)
- **Model Agnostic**: Allows seamless switching between models based on project needs and budget.[](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-t22mebxzwjhu6)

- **Third-Party Integration**: Natively integrates with observability platforms like Langfuse to capture detailed traces and metrics for every request.[](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/dify)
- **Annotation and Data Refinement**: Supports data annotation and model reasoning refinement to enhance application quality.[](https://dify.ai/)

#### f. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
- **Comprehensive APIs**: Provides RESTful APIs for integrating AI capabilities into existing applications, separating prompts from business logic.[](https://docs.dify.ai)
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high traffic and complex operations, suitable for enterprise-grade deployments.[](https://openalternative.co/dify)
- **Data Security**: Supports local deployment for full data control and encrypts sensitive information like API keys at rest.[](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/cloud)
