### **Key Knowledge Points of Coze**

#### **1. No-Code Interface**
- **Drag-and-Drop Builder**: Coze provides an intuitive visual editor that allows users to design chatbots without writing code. Users can create bots by selecting components, configuring settings, and defining interactions through a graphical interface.[](https://www.bestaitools.com/tool/coze/)
- **Accessibility**: The platform is designed for users with no programming background, making it ideal for marketers, customer support teams, educators, and content creators. Advanced users can still customize bots with more complex logic using workflows or APIs.[](https://www.b12.io/ai-directory/coze/)[](https://www.bestaitools.com/tool/coze/)
- **Persona Creation**: Users can define a bot’s character, tone, and behavior using natural language prompts, tailoring the bot’s personality to specific use cases (e.g., friendly customer service agent or professional consultant).[](https://www.yeschat.ai/blog-Complete-Coze-tutorial-Building-an-AI-chatbot-from-scratch-29443)

#### **2. Knowledge Base Management**
- **Custom Data Integration**: Coze allows users to upload external data (e.g., text files, PDFs, DOCX, Excel, or real-time web content via APIs) to create a knowledge base. This data is automatically segmented into discrete pieces of information called “segments.”[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge_overview.html)[](https://www.cmointern.com/2024/02/coze-powerful-yet-easy-to-use-ai.html)
- **Vector Search**: When a user queries the bot, Coze uses vector search to retrieve the most relevant segments from the knowledge base, ensuring accurate and contextually appropriate responses. For example, a bot with a knowledge base of car model data can answer specific queries like “What is the fuel consumption of a BMW X3?”[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge)[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge_overview.html)
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Customer Service**: Upload FAQs or product manuals to enable the bot to answer common questions.[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge_overview.html)
  - **Vertical Scenarios**: Create bots for specific industries, such as automotive or finance, by uploading detailed datasets.[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge_overview.html)
  - **Persona Simulation**: Build a bot that mimics a real person’s communication style by uploading their written content.[](https://www.coze.com/docs/knowledge_overview.html)

#### **3. Plugin System**
- **Extensive Plugin Library**: Coze offers over 60 built-in plugins, plus the ability to create custom plugins, to enhance bot functionality.

- **Functionality Expansion**: Plugins enable bots to perform tasks like retrieving real-time data, generating images, or processing user inputs. For instance, a travel bot can use a weather plugin to provide location-specific forecasts.[](https://www.yeschat.ai/blog-Complete-Coze-tutorial-Building-an-AI-chatbot-from-scratch-29443)[](https://www.cmointern.com/2024/02/coze-powerful-yet-easy-to-use-ai.html)
