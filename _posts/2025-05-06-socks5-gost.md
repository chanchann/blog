**GOST (GO Simple Tunnel)** is an open-source tunneling and proxy tool written in Go, designed to provide flexible and powerful proxying capabilities, including support for the SOCKS5 protocol. It is widely used for creating proxy servers, tunneling traffic, and bypassing network restrictions. While GOST is a robust and versatile tool, it is not necessarily the *most mainstream* SOCKS5 proxy tool, as its popularity depends on specific use cases and user communities. Below, I’ll provide a detailed analysis of GOST, how to use it, and whether it’s the most mainstream SOCKS5 proxy tool, based on its features, usage, and comparison with other tools.

---

#### **1. What is GOST?**
GOST is a tunneling and proxy framework that supports multiple protocols, including SOCKS5, SOCKS4, HTTP, HTTPS, Shadowsocks, and various transport protocols like TLS, WebSocket, QUIC, and KCP. It is highly configurable and can act as both a proxy server and a client, making it suitable for advanced networking scenarios such as bypassing censorship, port forwarding, and proxy chaining.

- **Key Features of GOST**:
  - **SOCKS5 Support**: Fully implements SOCKS5 protocol, including CONNECT, BIND, and UDP ASSOCIATE commands, as well as username/password authentication (RFC1929).[](https://gost.run/en/tutorials/protocols/socks/)
  - **Extended Encryption**: Supports TLS and TLS-AUTH for encrypted SOCKS5 communication when both client and server are GOST instances.[](https://v2.gost.run/en/socks/)
  - **UDP Relay**: Supports UDP-over-TCP for forwarding UDP data, critical for applications like DNS or gaming.[](https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/blob/master/README_en.md)
  - **Proxy Chaining**: Allows forwarding traffic through multiple proxy nodes (e.g., SOCKS5 to HTTP to Shadowsocks).[](https://v2.gost.run/en/getting-started/)
  - **Cross-Platform**: Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS (via third-party clients like ShadowsocksGostPlugin or Shadowrocket).[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)
  - **Advanced Protocols**: Supports KCP, QUIC, and WebSocket for optimized or censorship-resistant connections.[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)
  - **Web Management**: Some builds (e.g., for OpenWrt) include a web interface (luci-app-gost) for easy administration.[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)

- **Use Cases**:
  - Bypassing firewalls and censorship (popular in regions with heavy internet restrictions).
  - Creating SOCKS5 proxy servers for anonymous browsing, torrenting, or gaming.
  - Tunneling traffic for intranet penetration or remote access.
  - Proxy protocol conversion (e.g., SOCKS5 to HTTP).[](https://x.com/alswl/status/1748941468277100617)

#### **2. How to Use GOST as a SOCKS5 Proxy**
GOST is command-line driven but can be configured for simplicity. Below are steps to set up and use GOST as a SOCKS5 proxy server and client.

##### **Setting Up a SOCKS5 Proxy Server with GOST**
1. **Install GOST**:
   - Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the GOST release page:
     - Version 2: [ginuerzh/gost releases](https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/releases)[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)
     - Version 3: [go-gost/gost releases](https://github.com/go-gost/gost/releases) (under development, less stable)[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)
   - Example for Linux:
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/go-gost/gost/releases/download/v3.0.0-rc.8/gost_linux_amd64.tar.gz
     tar -xzf gost_linux_amd64.tar.gz
     sudo mv gost /usr/local/bin/
     ```

2. **Run a SOCKS5 Proxy Server**:
   - Start a basic SOCKS5 server on port 1080:
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://:1080
     ```
   - With username/password authentication:
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://admin:123456@:1080
     ```
   - Listen only on localhost:
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
     ```
   - Enable UDP relay:
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://:1080?udp=true
     ```

3. **Configuration File (Optional)**:
   - Create a YAML configuration file (e.g., `gost.yml`) for advanced setups:
     ```yaml
     services:
       - name: socks5-service
         addr: :1080
         handler:
           type: socks5
           auth:
             username: user
             password: pass
           metadata:
             udp: true
             bind: true
         listener:
           type: tcp
     ```
   - Run with the configuration file:
     ```bash
     gost -C gost.yml
     ```

4. **Test the Proxy**:
   - Use `curl` to verify the SOCKS5 proxy:
     ```bash
     curl -x socks5://admin:123456@localhost:1080 https://api.ipify.org
     ```
   - Use `socks5h` for remote DNS resolution:
     ```bash
     curl -x socks5h://admin:123456@localhost:1080 https://api.ipify.org
     ```

##### **Using GOST as a SOCKS5 Client**
1. **Forward Traffic to a Remote SOCKS5 Server**:
   - Example: Forward local traffic to a remote SOCKS5 server at `server_ip:1080`:
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://:1088 -F socks5://server_ip:1080
     ```
   - This creates a local SOCKS5 proxy on port 1088 that forwards traffic to the remote server.

2. **Proxy Chaining**:
   - Chain multiple proxies (e.g., SOCKS5 to HTTP):
     ```bash
     gost -L socks5://:1088 -F socks5://server_ip:1080 -F http://proxy2_ip:8080
     ```

3. **Use with Applications**:
   - Configure your application (e.g., browser, torrent client) to use the local SOCKS5 proxy at `127.0.0.1:1088`.

##### **Using GOST on OpenWrt**:
- Install GOST on OpenWrt using `opkg`:
  ```bash
  opkg update
  opkg install gost
  ```
- Use the `luci-app-gost` web interface for configuration (available in some OpenWrt packages).[](https://github.com/woodlyer/gostExample)

##### **Using GOST with Advanced Protocols**:
- Example: Use KCP for better performance:
  ```bash
  gost -L socks5://:1080 -F kcp://server_ip:9000?kcp.tcp=true
  ```
- Example: Use WebSocket with TLS:
  ```bash
  gost -L socks5://:1088 -F wss://server_ip:8443
  ```
