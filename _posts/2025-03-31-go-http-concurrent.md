In Go's net/http package, http.Client is designed to safely handle a large number of concurrent requests.

### Concurrent Request Handling Capacity

> "A single HTTP client can safely handle thousands of concurrent requests."

The http.Client is thread-safe (or more accurately in Go, goroutine-safe). It internally maintains a connection pool that allows multiple goroutines to use the same client instance concurrently without worrying about data races or requests interfering with each other. Typically, a single http.Client instance is sufficient to handle thousands of concurrent requests, provided that system resources (such as file descriptors, network bandwidth, etc.) have not reached their limits.

### Request Independence

> "You won't have issues with requests overwriting each other, as each request operates independently."

Each request made through http.Client (e.g., via client.Get() or client.Do()) runs independently. The underlying connection management is handled by http.Client and http.Transport, and requests won't interfere with or overwrite each other. The result of each request (e.g., http.Response) is also independent, allowing goroutines to safely handle their own response data.

### Connection Pool Management

> "The Go HTTP client (which your custom client is built on) manages a connection pool internally and is designed for concurrent use from multiple goroutines."

http.Client by default uses http.DefaultTransport (an implementation of the http.RoundTripper interface), which internally implements connection pool management. The connection pool supports HTTP/1.1's keep-alive mechanism and HTTP/2's multiplexing, allowing TCP connections to be reused across multiple goroutines. This design is particularly suitable for high-concurrency scenarios, avoiding the overhead of creating a new connection for each request.

### Concurrent Request Flow

> "When you make concurrent requests:"

- Each request runs in its own goroutine
- The client maintains a pool of connections for reuse
- Requests don't interfere with each other - they're queued if needed
- Your rate limiter middleware will still properly throttle requests

## Additional Notes

- **Default Configuration Suitability**: http.DefaultClient (the default http.Client instance) is already sufficient to handle most concurrent scenarios. If more fine-grained control is needed (such as timeouts, maximum connections, etc.), you can customize http.Client and http.Transport.

- **Performance Considerations**: While http.Client can handle thousands of concurrent requests, actual performance still depends on server response speed, network latency, and local resource limitations (such as CPU, memory, and file descriptors).

- **Best Practices**: In high-concurrency scenarios, it's recommended to reuse a single http.Client instance rather than creating a new client for each request, as creating a new client would lose the benefits of connection pooling.
