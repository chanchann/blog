The competition between Chinese and American companies for stablecoin dominance is driven by a mix of economic, technological, and geopolitical factors. Below is an analysis of the key reasons behind this race:

1. **Global Financial Influence and Currency Dominance**  
   Stablecoins, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, are becoming critical tools for global transactions due to their stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. American companies, such as Circle (issuer of USDC) and Tether (issuer of USDT), dominate the stablecoin market, with over 98% of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar. This reinforces the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency, giving the U.S. significant financial influence. For example, stablecoins facilitate $27.6 trillion in annual transfer volume, surpassing traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard.

   Chinese companies, on the other hand, see yuan-backed stablecoins as a way to challenge this dollar hegemony and promote the yuan’s global adoption. Chinese state media has urged the government to accelerate yuan-backed stablecoin development to counter U.S. dominance, reflecting a strategic push to enhance China’s financial influence amid de-dollarization trends.[](https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1903003677834494443)[](https://x.com/MartiniGuyYT/status/1903398758047514917)

2. **Efficiency in Cross-Border Payments**  
   Stablecoins enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions compared to traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take 1-3 days and charge fees up to 6.35%. Stablecoin transactions, such as those using USDC, settle in seconds with fees as low as 0.1%-0.3%. American companies are capitalizing on this to disrupt legacy payment systems, with firms like PayPal (issuer of PYUSD) and Stripe entering the stablecoin market to capture market share in global remittances and payments.

   Chinese companies aim to leverage stablecoins to facilitate trade in yuan, especially in regions like ASEAN, the Middle East, and BRICS nations, where China is increasingly settling trades in local currencies or yuan. This reduces reliance on U.S.-controlled financial infrastructure and aligns with China’s broader Belt and Road Initiative.[](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/stablecoins-as-a-us-financial-ally)

3. **Geopolitical Strategy and De-Dollarization**  
   The U.S. is pushing stablecoin regulation (e.g., the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act) to ensure dollar-backed stablecoins maintain global dominance while complying with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. This strengthens U.S. oversight of global financial flows and counters illicit activities like sanctions evasion.

   China, however, views dollar-backed stablecoins as a threat to its monetary sovereignty. By developing yuan-backed stablecoins, China aims to reduce dependence on the dollar, especially in light of U.S. sanctions and trade tensions. For instance, Russia and China now settle 92% of their trade in rubles and yuan, reflecting a shift away from dollar-based systems. Yuan-backed stablecoins could further this trend, giving China more control over its financial ecosystem.[](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/stablecoins-as-a-us-financial-ally)

4. **Access to Emerging Markets and the Unbanked**  
   Stablecoins are gaining traction in emerging markets with unstable currencies, such as Argentina, Nigeria, and Turkey, where they serve as a hedge against inflation and a tool for remittances. In 2024, Latin America received $415 billion in cryptocurrency, with stablecoins playing a significant role. American companies benefit from this demand, as dollar-pegged stablecoins are preferred for their stability and global acceptance.  [](https://www.gate.com/learn/articles/the-era-of-stablecoins-how-are-china-and-the-u-s-competing/9446)
   Chinese companies see an opportunity to introduce yuan-backed stablecoins in these markets, particularly in regions where China has strong trade ties. This could expand the yuan’s reach and provide an alternative to dollar-based stablecoins for the unbanked and underbanked populations.[](https://business.cornell.edu/article/2025/04/stablecoins-importance-in-emerging-markets/)

5. **Technological Innovation and Market Opportunities**  
   Stablecoins are programmable currencies that integrate with blockchain and AI technologies, enabling innovative financial applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized assets. American companies, supported by a robust fintech ecosystem, are leveraging stablecoins to create new payment ecosystems and capture market share from traditional players like Visa and SWIFT.

   Chinese companies, backed by state support and tech giants like Alipay and WeChat Pay, aim to integrate yuan-backed stablecoins into their digital payment platforms. This could enhance China’s digital economy and position its firms as leaders in blockchain-based finance.[](https://www.coinbase.com/institutional/research-insights/research/market-intelligence/stablecoins-new-payments-landscape)

6. **Regulatory and Market Challenges**  
   The U.S. is advancing stablecoin regulation to ensure transparency, reserve backing, and consumer protection, which could give American companies a competitive edge by fostering trust. However, strict regulations (e.g., requiring U.S. Treasury bonds as reserves) may increase costs for issuers like Tether, potentially opening opportunities for competitors.

   China’s regulatory environment is more restrictive, with a ban on cryptocurrency transactions, but there is growing interest in regulated yuan-backed stablecoins to compete globally. Hong Kong’s Stablecoins Bill, for instance, focuses on regulating Hong Kong dollar stablecoins while allowing licensed non-HKD stablecoins for retail investors, creating a controlled entry point for Chinese firms.[](https://www.gate.com/learn/articles/the-era-of-stablecoins-how-are-china-and-the-u-s-competing/9446)[](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/the-hong-kong-stablecoins-bill-and-its-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape)

**Conclusion**  
The competition for stablecoin dominance between Chinese and American companies is a battle for financial, technological, and geopolitical supremacy. American firms aim to solidify the dollar’s global role and disrupt traditional payment systems, while Chinese firms seek to promote the yuan, reduce dollar dependency, and expand influence in emerging markets. The outcome will depend on regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and the ability to capture global trust and adoption.
