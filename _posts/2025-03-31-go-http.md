Go's net/http package is one of the core libraries in the standard library for handling HTTP requests and responses. It is designed to be concise, efficient, and well-suited for concurrent scenarios. Below is a detailed explanation of net/http, covering its core components, working principles, and key points for usage.

## 1. Core Components

The most critical parts of the net/http package are:

### (1) http.Client

**Purpose**: http.Client is the main tool for making HTTP requests. It encapsulates request sending, connection management, and response processing.

**Key Features**:
- Thread-safe: Can be safely reused across multiple goroutines.
- Connection pool: Manages connections through the underlying http.Transport, supporting keep-alive and connection reuse.
- Configurable: Supports timeout settings (Timeout), custom transport layers (Transport), redirect policies (CheckRedirect), etc.
- Default instance: http.DefaultClient is a ready-to-use default client suitable for most simple scenarios.

**Common Methods**:
- Get(), Post(), Head(): Convenience methods for directly initiating requests.
- Do(req *http.Request): A more flexible method allowing customized requests.

### (2) http.Transport

**Purpose**: http.Transport is the underlying implementation of http.Client, responsible for actual network communication (TCP connections, TLS handshakes, etc.).

**Core Functions**:
- Connection pool management: Maintains idle connections, supports HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and HTTP/2 multiplexing.

**Configuration Options**:
- MaxIdleConns: Maximum number of idle connections.
- MaxConnsPerHost: Maximum connections per host.
- IdleConnTimeout: Lifetime of idle connections.
- TLSClientConfig: Custom TLS configuration.
- Connection reuse: Avoids establishing new connections for each request, improving performance.

**Note**: http.DefaultTransport is the default configuration, usually requiring no modification, but may need adjustment in high-concurrency scenarios.

### (3) http.Request

**Purpose**: Represents an HTTP request, including method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and request body.

**Creation Methods**:
- http.NewRequest(): Manually construct a request.
- Implicitly created through http.Client convenience methods (e.g., http.Get()).

**Key Fields**:
- Method: HTTP method.
- URL: Target address.
- Header: Request headers.
- Body: Request body (implements the io.ReadCloser interface).

### (4) http.Response

**Purpose**: Represents the HTTP response returned by the server.

**Key Fields**:
- StatusCode: Status code (e.g., 200, 404).
- Header: Response headers.
- Body: Response body (must be manually closed, e.g., defer resp.Body.Close()).

**Note**: The Body must be closed after reading, otherwise it may lead to resource leaks (such as unreleased connections).

### (5) http.Server

**Purpose**: Used to create an HTTP server, listen for requests, and handle them.

**Core Methods**:
- ListenAndServe(): Start the server.
- ServeMux: Built-in multiplexer (router), register handlers through http.Handle() or http.HandleFunc().

**Configuration**:
- Addr: Listening address.
- Handler: Request handler (default is http.DefaultServeMux).

### (6) http.Handler and http.HandlerFunc

**Purpose**: Define how the server handles requests.

**Difference**:
- http.Handler is an interface containing the ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) method.
- http.HandlerFunc is a function type with the same signature as ServeHTTP, which can be used directly as a handler.

**Usage**: Bind paths and handlers through http.Handle().

## 2. Working Principles

The request and response flow of net/http can be summarized as follows:

### Client Flow

1. Create request: Construct http.Request through http.NewRequest() or convenience methods.
2. Send request: Call http.Client.Do(), passing the request to Transport.
3. Connection management: Transport checks the connection pool:
   - If idle connections exist: Reuse.
   - If no idle connections: Establish a new connection (constrained by configuration).
4. Receive response: Server returns http.Response, client reads Body and processes it.

### Server Flow

1. Start server: Call http.Server.ListenAndServe().
2. Route dispatching: After receiving a request, ServeMux matches the registered Handler based on the URL path.
3. Handle request: Call Handler.ServeHTTP(), return response through http.ResponseWriter.

## 3. Concurrent Design

The concurrent capability of net/http is one of its highlights, mainly reflected in:

### (1) Client Concurrency

- Connection pool: http.Transport allows multiple goroutines to share the connection pool, avoiding resource waste.
- Independent requests: Each request's http.Request and http.Response are independent, with no interference between goroutines.
- Goroutine-friendly: No lock mechanism required, naturally supports high concurrency.

### (2) Server Concurrency

- One goroutine per request: http.Server automatically allocates a goroutine to handle each incoming request.
- Non-blocking: Handler logic can be executed asynchronously (e.g., calling a database or external API), without affecting other requests.

## 4. Key Points for Usage

Here are important points to note when using net/http in practice:

### (1) Client Best Practices

**Reuse http.Client**: Avoid creating a new client for each request; reuse instances to leverage the connection pool.

```go
client := &http.Client{
    Timeout: 10 * time.Second, // Set timeout
}
resp, err := client.Get("https://example.com")
```

**Close response body**: Always close resp.Body after reading.

```go
resp, err := http.Get("https://example.com")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer resp.Body.Close()
```

**Custom Transport**: Adjust connection pool parameters for high-concurrency scenarios.

```go
transport := &http.Transport{
    MaxIdleConns:        100,
    MaxConnsPerHost:     50,
    IdleConnTimeout:     30 * time.Second,
}
client := &http.Client{Transport: transport}
```

### (2) Server Best Practices

**Route management**: Use http.ServeMux or third-party routing libraries (like gorilla/mux).

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
})
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)
```

**Timeout settings**: Prevent requests from hanging.

```go
server := &http.Server{
    Addr:         ":8080",
    Handler:      mux,
    ReadTimeout:  10 * time.Second,
    WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
server.ListenAndServe()
```

**Graceful shutdown**: Support smoothly stopping the server.

```go
server.Shutdown(context.Background())
```

### (3) Error Handling

Check for network errors, status codes, etc.

```go
resp, err := http.Get("https://example.com")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
    log.Printf("Unexpected status: %v", resp.Status)
}
```

## 5. Advanced Features

**Middleware**: Implement logging, authentication, etc., by wrapping http.Handler.

```go
func loggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        log.Printf("Request: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

**HTTP/2 Support**: Enabled by default (requires server support).

**Custom Protocols**: Extend Transport through the http.RoundTripper interface.

## 6. Performance and Limitations

**Advantages**:
- Efficient connection reuse.
- Natural support for high concurrency.
- Simple API.

**Limitations**:
- Default configuration may not be suitable for extreme scenarios (manual adjustment needed).
- Does not provide advanced routing or web framework features (third-party libraries needed).

## Summary

net/http is a powerful and elegantly designed library, with its core being the high-concurrency support for both client (http.Client) and server (http.Server). The client handles a large number of requests through connection pools and goroutine-safe design, while the server efficiently responds through the goroutine-per-request model. Understanding its components (Client, Transport, Request, Response, Server) and configuration options is key to mastering it.
