### 2. **Key Knowledge Points for Using SimNow CTP API**

#### **2.1. Account Setup and Access**
- **Registration**:  
  To use the SimNow CTP API, you need to register an account on the SimNow website (http://www.simnow.com.cn/).  
  - Use a valid Chinese mobile number (China Mobile or China Unicom recommended) or email for registration, as verification codes are sent to these.  
  - Each phone number or email can only register one account.  
  - After registration, you’ll receive an **Investor ID** (not the phone number) and a password. The Investor ID is used for API logins, and the password must be changed after the first login for API access.  [](https://chowdera.com/2021/04/20210402034934921f.html)[](https://blog.csdn.net/Le_temps/article/details/136527194)
  - New accounts may take up to the third trading day to access certain environments (e.g., the second CTP API testing environment).[](https://www.simnow.com.cn/product.action)

- **Broker ID**:  
  For SimNow, the Broker ID is standardized as **9999** for all users. This is used in API configurations to identify the simulated brokerage environment.[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)

- **Password Management**:  
  - Change the default password via the SimNow website (“Forget Password” option) or through the SimNow Fast Client software.  
  - Ensure the password for API trading is distinct from real trading environments to avoid security risks.[](https://chowdera.com/2021/04/20210402034934921f.html)[](https://www.simnow.com.cn/static/softwareDownload.action)

The CTP API consists of several key components, which are defined in header files and libraries available for download from the SimNow website (http://www.simnow.com.cn/static/apiDownload.action). These include:  
- **Header Files**:  
  - `ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h`: Defines data types used by the API (e.g., price, volume).  
  - `ThostFtdcUserApiStruct.h`: Defines data structures for trading and market data.  
  - `FtdcTraderApi.h`: Trading interface for order placement, cancellation, and account queries.  
  - `ThostFtdcMdApi.h`: Market data interface for subscribing to quotes and receiving market updates.[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)

- **Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)**:  
  - `thosttraderapi.dll`: For trading operations.  
  - `thostmduserapi.dll`: For market data operations.  
  - Corresponding `.lib` files (`thosttraderapi.lib`, `thostmduserapi.lib`) are used for linking in C++ applications.[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)

- **Communication Modes**:  
  The CTP API supports three communication modes:  
  - **Dialogue Mode**: Client-initiated requests (e.g., login, order placement, queries) with responses from the server.  
  - **Private Mode**: Server pushes order updates, trade confirmations, or errors to the client.  
  - **Broadcast Mode**: Server pushes market quotes (e.g., price updates) to all subscribed clients.[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)[](https://www.fmz.com/lang/en/digest-topic/6073)

#### **2.4. Key API Functionalities**
- **Market Data (MdApi)**:  
  - Subscribe to real-time market quotes for specific contracts (e.g., futures on commodities like copper, soybeans, or crude oil).  
  - Receive tick-level data (2 ticks per second, lower than some cryptocurrency APIs).  
  - Note: SimNow does not provide historical market data or tick-by-tick transaction data; historical data must be sourced from third-party providers.[](https://www.fmz.com/lang/en/digest-topic/6073)[](https://blog.csdn.net/Le_temps/article/details/136527194)

- **Trading (TraderApi)**:  
  - **Order Types**: Supports limit orders, Fill-and-Kill (FAK), and Fill-or-Kill (FOK) orders. Market orders are **not** supported in SimNow.  
  - **Order Management**: Place, modify, or cancel orders. Orders can be monitored via the API’s private communication mode.  
  - **Position and Account Queries**: Retrieve account balances, positions, and order statuses.[](https://chowdera.com/2021/04/20210402034934921f.html)

- **Authentication**:  
  - Default APPID: `simnow_client_test`  
  - Default Authentication Code: `0000000000000000` (16 zeros).  
  - Terminal authentication can be disabled for programmatic access.[](https://www.simnow.com.cn/product.action)

#### **2.5. Trading Rules and Limitations**
- **Contract Rules**:  
  SimNow contracts follow the trading rules of the SHFE, including margin requirements, price limits, and settlement procedures. Ensure your trading strategy complies with these rules.[](http://algo.plus/api/ctp/simnow.html)

- **Order Restrictions**:  
  - CTP imposes strict limits on request frequency (e.g., one request every 2 seconds is considered safe).  
  - Excessive order submissions or cancellations may trigger restrictions.[](https://www.fmz.com/lang/en/digest-topic/6073)

- **No Tick-by-Tick Transaction Data**:  
  Unlike some cryptocurrency APIs, SimNow’s CTP API does not provide detailed transaction-level data. Transaction details must be inferred from position changes.[](https://www.fmz.com/lang/en/digest-topic/6073)

#### **2.6. Development and Integration**
- **Supported Languages**:  
  The CTP API is primarily designed for C++ but can be wrapped for other languages like Python or Rust using libraries like `pybind11` or `cc-rs`. For example, Python developers can refer to tutorials on wrapping CTP APIs (e.g., https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20031660).[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)

- **Development Steps**:  
  1. **Download API Files**: Obtain the necessary DLLs and header files from http://www.simnow.com.cn/static/apiDownload.action.  
  2. **Set Up Environment**: Configure the trading and market data server addresses in your application.  
  3. **Implement Callbacks**: Use callback functions to handle market data updates, order confirmations, and errors.  
  4. **Test Connectivity**: Use tools like `telnet` to verify server connectivity before running your application.  
  5. **Debug and Log**: Monitor logs for initialization and connection status (e.g., TradeAPI and MdAPI login success).[](https://chowdera.com/2021/04/20210402034934921f.html)[](https://blog.csdn.net/Le_temps/article/details/136527194)

- **Libraries for Integration**:  
  - For Rust: Use `libloading` or `libc` for FFI bindings.  
  - For Python: Use `pybind11` or similar to interface with C++ DLLs.  
  - Ensure memory safety when unloading libraries to avoid dangling pointers.[](https://blog.birost.com/a?ID=00950-ea66ed88-85a8-469b-8910-f7340ba53235)
