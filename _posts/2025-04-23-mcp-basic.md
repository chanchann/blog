The term **MCP** you're referring to is likely the **Model Context Protocol**, an open standard introduced by Anthropic in late 2024 to streamline how AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), interact with external data sources and tools.

---

### What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open-source, standardized client-server protocol designed to connect AI models (like Claude, ChatGPT, or LLaMA) to external systems, such as databases, APIs, file systems, or productivity tools. Think of MCP as a "universal adapter" or "USB-C for AI integrations" that simplifies the process of providing AI agents with real-time context and actionable capabilities.[](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/the-model-context-protocol-mcp-the-ultimate-guide-c40539e2a8e7)

Before MCP, integrating AI with external tools required custom-built, one-off integrations for each service, which was time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to scale. MCP addresses the **NxM problem**—where N represents the number of LLMs and M represents the number of tools—by providing a single, reusable protocol to connect them. This reduces development overhead, enhances interoperability, and fosters a growing ecosystem of reusable tools.[](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp)

**Key Features of MCP**:
1. **Standardized Interface**: MCP defines a universal way for AI models to discover and interact with tools, resources, and prompts dynamically at runtime.[](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/developer-guide-to-mcp)
2. **Two-Way Communication**: Unlike read-only methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), MCP enables AI to both retrieve data and perform actions (e.g., sending emails, updating databases).[](https://www.quickchat.ai/post/mcp-explained)
3. **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: AI models can query MCP servers to learn available tools without hard-coded integrations.[](https://norahsakal.com/blog/mcp-vs-api-model-context-protocol-explained/)
4. **Security-First Design**: MCP uses OAuth 2.1 for authentication, supports access controls, and allows scoping to limit what AI can access or do.[](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/developer-guide-to-mcp)[](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mcp-and-authorization/)
5. **Open Ecosystem**: With thousands of MCP servers already available (e.g., for GitHub, Slack, or vector databases), the community is rapidly expanding the protocol’s capabilities.[](https://waleedk.medium.com/what-is-mcp-and-why-you-should-pay-attention-31524da7733f)

### Knowledge Points

To understand MCP thoroughly, here are the core concepts and components:

1. **MCP Architecture**:
   - **MCP Host**: The application running the AI model (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, or a custom AI app). It manages connections to MCP servers and controls what the AI can access.[](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mcp-and-authorization/)
   - **MCP Client**: A component that establishes a one-to-one connection with an MCP server, handling communication and context exchange. Often, the host and client are synonymous in practice.[](https://waleedk.medium.com/what-is-mcp-and-why-you-should-pay-attention-31524da7733f)
   - **MCP Server**: A standalone system that exposes tools, resources, or prompts to the AI. For example, a GitHub MCP server might allow the AI to create issues or pull requests.[](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp)
   - **Transport Layer**: MCP supports local (STDIO) and remote (HTTP + Server-Sent Events) communication, using JSON-RPC 2.0 for structured messaging.[](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp)

2. **Core Primitives**:
   - **Tools**: Callable functions or APIs (e.g., sending a Slack message, querying a database).[](https://medium.com/data-reply-it-datatech/understanding-mcp-a-smarter-way-to-talk-to-model-a74a515701f6)
   - **Resources**: Data sources like files, URLs, or knowledge bases that the AI can query.[](https://medium.com/data-reply-it-datatech/understanding-mcp-a-smarter-way-to-talk-to-model-a74a515701f6)
   - **Prompts**: Structured templates that guide how the AI interacts with tools or formats responses.[](https://medium.com/data-reply-it-datatech/understanding-mcp-a-smarter-way-to-talk-to-model-a74a515701f6)
   - **Roots**: Entry points to a host’s file system or environment, accessible with permission.[](https://blog.promptlayer.com/mcp/)
   - **Sampling**: A mechanism where the server requests the AI to generate completions for multi-step reasoning, often with human approval.[](https://blog.promptlayer.com/mcp/)

3. **Comparison to Alternatives**:
   - **Traditional APIs**: Require custom code for each integration, leading to fragmented, brittle connections. MCP provides a single protocol for multiple services.[](https://norahsakal.com/blog/mcp-vs-api-model-context-protocol-explained/)
   - **OpenAI Plugins/GPT Actions**: These are platform-specific and require manual setup for each tool. MCP is open and platform-agnostic.[](https://www.quickchat.ai/post/mcp-explained)
   - **RAG**: Focused on retrieving static knowledge, RAG is read-only. MCP supports both retrieval and action execution.[](https://www.quickchat.ai/post/mcp-explained)
   - **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: MCP adapts LSP’s client-server model but is tailored for AI, emphasizing dynamic tool discovery and action-oriented workflows.[](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mcp)

4. **Security and Scalability**:
   - MCP mandates OAuth 2.1 for secure authentication and supports dynamic client registration to simplify onboarding.[](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mcp-and-authorization/)
   - Servers can run locally or remotely (e.g., on Cloudflare or AWS), making MCP versatile for both personal and enterprise use.[](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/developer-guide-to-mcp)
   - Community tools like **MCP Guardian** help log requests and enforce policies, though enterprise-grade security is still evolving.[](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp)

5. **Ecosystem Growth**:
   - As of March 2025, thousands of MCP servers exist, covering tools like GitHub, Slack, PostgreSQL, Weaviate, and even creative apps like Blender and Figma.[](https://waleedk.medium.com/what-is-mcp-and-why-you-should-pay-attention-31524da7733f)[](https://mcp.so/)
   - Community resources like **awesome-mcp-servers** and **mcp.so** catalog available servers, making it easy to discover and integrate tools.[](https://addyo.substack.com/p/mcp-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters)[](https://mcp.so/)

### How to Use MCP

Using MCP involves setting up an MCP server, connecting it to an MCP client/host, and enabling the AI to interact with external tools. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Understand Your Use Case**:
   - Identify the tools or data sources you want the AI to access (e.g., a database, GitHub, or a calendar app).
   - Determine whether you need a local or remote MCP server.

2. **Set Up an MCP Server**:
   - **Option 1: Use an Existing Server**:
     - Browse repositories like **mcp.so** or **awesome-mcp-servers** to find pre-built servers for popular services (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or Weaviate).[](https://mcp.so/)
     - Install the server following its documentation. For example, the PostgreSQL MCP server requires configuring a connection string to your database.[](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mcp)
   - **Option 2: Build Your Own Server**:
     - Use SDKs like **fastmcp** (Python) or **mcp-framework** (TypeScript) to create a server.[](https://medium.com/data-reply-it-datatech/understanding-mcp-a-smarter-way-to-talk-to-model-a74a515701f6)
     - Define tools using the `server.tool()` method, specifying parameters and metadata. For example, a document search tool might accept a query string and return results from a knowledge base.[](https://blog.logto.io/what-is-mcp)
     - Example (Node.js, simplified):
       ```javascript
       const { MCPServer } = require('mcp-framework');
       const server = new MCPServer();
       server.tool('search-documents', {
         description: 'Search knowledge base',
         parameters: { query: 'string', maxResults: 'number' },
         async execute({ query, maxResults }) {
           // Connect to knowledge base and return results
           return await searchKnowledgeBase(query, maxResults);
         }
       });
       server.start();
       ```
      [](https://blog.logto.io/what-is-mcp)

3. **Configure an MCP Client/Host**:
   - Use an MCP-compatible application like **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor IDE**, **Theia IDE**, or **Cline**.[](https://a16z.com/a-deep-dive-into-mcp-and-the-future-of-ai-tooling/)[](https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2024/12/19/theia-ide-and-theia-ai-support-mcp/)
   - Add the MCP server to the host’s configuration. For example, in Cursor, update the settings to point to your server’s address or connection string.[](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mcp)
   - The client will initialize a connection, retrieve the server’s capabilities (e.g., available tools), and make them accessible to the AI.[](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mcp-and-authorization/)

4. **Interact with the AI**:
   - Prompt the AI through the host application. The LLM will decide whether to use an MCP tool based on the prompt and available tools.
   - Example: In Cursor, you might prompt, “Check my GitHub repo for open issues.” The AI uses the GitHub MCP server to fetch data and respond.[](https://a16z.com/a-deep-dive-into-mcp-and-the-future-of-ai-tooling/)
   - For complex workflows, the AI can chain multiple MCP servers (e.g., query a database, generate a report, and post it to Slack).

5. **Best Practices**:
   - **Security**: Use TLS for remote connections, sanitize inputs, and configure access scopes to limit AI actions.[](https://daily.dev/blog/what-is-mcp-model-context-protocol)
   - **Error Handling**: Validate inputs with schemas, return clear error messages, and support graceful degradation.[](https://www.digidop.com/blog/mcp-ai-revolution)
   - **Monitoring**: Log tool usage for auditing and debugging, especially in enterprise settings.[](https://medium.com/data-reply-it-datatech/understanding-mcp-a-smarter-way-to-talk-to-model-a74a515701f6)
   - **Testing**: Test edge cases and ensure compatibility with multiple hosts (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor).[](https://www.digidop.com/blog/mcp-ai-revolution)

6. **Explore Community Resources**:
   - Check **mcp.so** for server catalogs and tutorials.[](https://mcp.so/)
