# Claude Code Best Practices - Executive Summary

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Customization is Essential**
- Create CLAUDE.md files to document project-specific commands, style guides, and workflows
- Configure tool access based on security needs
- Continuously refine settings based on experience

### 2. **Extend Functionality**
- Integrate with bash tools and custom scripts
- Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external services
- Create custom slash commands for repetitive tasks

### 3. **Follow Structured Workflows**
- **Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**: Systematic feature development
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implement
- **Visual Design Iteration**: Use screenshots and mockups for UI work

### 4. **Optimize Communication**
- Be specific and detailed in instructions
- Use visual aids (images, mockups) when relevant
- Course-correct early if misunderstood
- Keep context focused with `/clear` command

### 5. **Advanced Techniques**
- Run multiple Claude instances for parallel work
- Use git worktrees for isolated experiments
- Spawn subagents for complex research tasks
- Automate workflows with headless mode

## Quick Start Recommendations

1. Start with a basic CLAUDE.md file documenting your project's build and test commands
2. Experiment with different workflows to find what suits your style
3. Gradually add customizations as you identify patterns
4. Share successful configurations with your team

## Bottom Line

Claude Code's power comes from its flexibility. The tool adapts to your workflow rather than forcing you into a predetermined pattern. Success requires initial setup investment but pays dividends in improved productivity and code quality.
