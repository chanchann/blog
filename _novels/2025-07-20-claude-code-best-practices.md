# Claude Code Best Practices

Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding that aims to be flexible, customizable, and effective for various development workflows.

## Core Principles

### 1. Customize Your Setup

The foundation of effective Claude Code usage lies in proper customization:

- **CLAUDE.md Files**: Create documentation files that serve as persistent memory for Claude, containing:
  - Common bash commands and their purposes
  - Code style guidelines and conventions
  - Testing instructions and procedures
  - Developer environment setup details
  - Project-specific requirements

- **Tool Selection**: Curate a list of allowed tools to enhance safety and efficiency. You can disable potentially risky tools while keeping the ones essential for your workflow.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously update your configuration based on experience. Each project might benefit from different settings and documentation.

### 2. Extend Claude's Capabilities

Claude Code becomes more powerful when extended:

- **Bash Integration**: Leverage existing bash tools and create custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Use MCP servers to connect Claude with external services and APIs
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Create reusable commands for common workflows

## Recommended Workflows

### A. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

A systematic approach to feature development:

1. **Exploration**: Read and understand relevant files in the codebase
2. **Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan
3. **Coding**: Implement the solution step by step
4. **Version Control**: Commit changes and create pull requests

### B. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Implement features with confidence:

1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Confirm tests fail initially
3. Implement code to make tests pass
4. Iterate and refine
5. Commit when all tests pass

### C. Visual Design Iteration

For UI/UX development:

1. Take screenshots of current state
2. Provide visual mockups or descriptions
3. Implement design changes
4. Review and iterate based on visual feedback
5. Commit when design meets requirements

## Optimization Strategies

### Communication Tips

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions rather than vague requests
- **Use Visual Context**: Include images, screenshots, and mockups when relevant
- **Provide References**: Share URLs, documentation links, and code examples
- **Course-Correct Early**: Don't wait if Claude misunderstands; clarify immediately

### Context Management

- **Use /clear**: Reset context when switching between unrelated tasks
- **Focused Sessions**: Keep each session focused on a specific goal
- **Relevant Information**: Only include files and information directly related to the current task

### Performance Enhancement

- **Headless Mode**: Use for automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- **Multiple Instances**: Run several Claude instances for parallel development
- **Git Worktrees**: Use separate worktrees for different features or experiments

## Advanced Techniques

### Subagent Utilization

For complex tasks requiring extensive research or exploration:
- Spawn subagents for specific investigations
- Let subagents handle time-consuming searches
- Focus main session on implementation

### Workflow Automation

- Create scripts that invoke Claude Code for repetitive tasks
- Use in CI/CD pipelines for automated code review
- Integrate with existing development tools

### Project-Specific Optimization

- Tailor CLAUDE.md files for each project's unique needs
- Create project-specific slash commands
- Document team conventions and standards

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic usage and gradually add complexity
2. **Document Everything**: Maintain comprehensive CLAUDE.md files
3. **Experiment Freely**: Try different approaches to find what works best
4. **Safety First**: Configure tools appropriately for your security needs
5. **Iterate Continuously**: Refine your setup based on experience
6. **Share Knowledge**: Document successful patterns for team members

## Conclusion

Claude Code's effectiveness comes from its flexibility and customizability. By following these best practices and adapting them to your specific needs, you can create a powerful development assistant that enhances your productivity while maintaining code quality and safety standards.

The key is experimentationâ€”find the workflows that best suit your development style and continuously refine them based on your experience.
