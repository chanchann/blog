### Key Points
- Research suggests Chile was inhabited since at least 15,000 years ago, with Monte Verde as a key early site.
- The evidence leans toward northern Chile hosting the Chinchorro, Aymara, and Atacameños, each with distinct cultures.
- It seems likely that central and southern Chile saw the Pitrén and El Vergel cultures, precursors to the Mapuche, known for resistance.
- The far south had nomadic groups like the Selk'nam, adapted to harsh conditions, with a rich cultural heritage.

#### Early Settlement
Chile's pre-colonial history begins with the earliest human presence, dated to around 15,000 years ago at the Monte Verde site ([Prehispanic history of Chile - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehispanic_history_of_Chile)). This site, located in southern Chile, shows evidence of a sophisticated society using diverse resources, challenging traditional views on the peopling of the Americas.

#### Northern Indigenous Cultures
In the north, the Chinchorro culture (7,000-1,500 BCE) is notable for its early mummification practices, predating Egyptian mummies, and was centered around coastal fishing ([Chinchorro culture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchorro_culture)). The Aymara, part of a broader Andean sphere, were influenced by the Wari and later Incas, engaging in agriculture and trade ([Trekkingchile - Aymara](https://www.trekkingchile.com/en/chile-info/aymara/)). The Atacameños, or Licanantay, adapted to the Atacama Desert, developing advanced crafts and agriculture in oases ([Atacama people - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_people)).

#### Central and Southern Cultures
Central and southern Chile were home to the Pitrén (100-1100 CE) and El Vergel (1100-1500 CE) cultures, early agro-pottery societies transitioning from hunting to farming ([Chile Precolombino - Pitrén](https://chileprecolombino.cl/en/prehistoria/culturas/sur/pitren/historia/)). These groups are seen as precursors to the Mapuche, known for their resistance against external domination and rich cultural traditions ([Mapuche history - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche_history)).

#### Far Southern Tribes
In the far south, nomadic hunter-gatherers like the Selk'nam, Kawésqar, and Yaghan lived in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, adapting to harsh conditions with unique cultural practices, including elaborate rituals ([Selk'nam people - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%27nam_people)).

### A Detailed History of Pre-Colonial Chile

Chile's pre-colonial history is a rich tapestry of indigenous cultures, each adapted to the diverse ecological zones from the arid deserts of the north to the temperate forests and cold steppes of the south. This survey note provides a comprehensive overview, from the earliest human settlements to the complex societies present at the time of Spanish arrival in 1540, based on extensive research from reliable sources.

#### Early Settlement and Prehistoric Foundations
The earliest evidence of human presence in Chile dates back at least 15,000 years, with the Monte Verde archaeological site in southern Chile, near Puerto Montt, providing crucial insights ([Prehispanic history of Chile - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehispanic_history_of_Chile)). This open-air Paleolithic site, well-preserved due to an anaerobic bog environment, includes Monte Verde II (MV-II), dated to 14,550–14,500 calibrated years Before Present (BP), or approximately 12,550–12,500 BCE, with evidence of wooden tent-like structures, hearths, and a diverse diet including seaweed, tubers, and butchered megafauna like Notiomastodon ([Monte Verde - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verde)). Research suggests Monte Verde I (MV-I) may date back to 18,500–14,500 cal BP, though this is less accepted due to meagre evidence. The site challenges the "Clovis first" model, supporting a coastal migration hypothesis for the peopling of the Americas.

Theories on settlement, such as Paul Rivet's, propose multiple arrivals via the Bering Straits, Polynesia, Melanesia, and Central America, with various research suggesting first populations arrived around 35,000 BC during the Pleistocene for MV-I and 15,000 BC for MV-II ([Prehispanic history of Chile - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehispanic_history_of_Chile)). This early presence indicates a long history of human adaptation to Chile's varied landscapes.

| **Site**         | **Age (cal BP)** | **Key Features**                                      |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Monte Verde II   | 14,550–14,500    | Wooden structures, hearths, diverse diet, seaweed use |
| Monte Verde I    | 18,500–14,500    | Controversial, clay-lined burned areas, stone tools   |

#### Northern Indigenous Cultures
Northern Chile, particularly the Atacama Desert region, was home to several distinct indigenous groups, each with unique adaptations to the arid environment. The Chinchorro culture, active from 9,100 to 3,500 years BP (7,000 to 1,500 BCE), was a sedentary fishing society along the Pacific coast, from Ilo, Peru, to Antofagasta, Chile, with its cultural core in the Arica-Camarones region ([Chinchorro culture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinchorro_culture)). They relied 90% on maritime resources, using fishing hooks made of shells and cactuses, and are famous for their early mummification practices, starting around 7,000 BC, predating Egyptian mummies. Their mummies evolved from black (manganese) to red (around 2000 BC) pigments, influenced by high infant mortality due to arsenic exposure, and were recognized by UNESCO in 2021 ([UNESCO World Heritage List](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1634/)). Key archaeologist Dr. Bernardo Arriaza's works, such as his 1995 National Geographic article ([National Geographic Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20120819043230/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/1995/03/chinchorro-mummies/arriaza-text)), highlight their significance.

The Aymara, part of a broader Andean cultural sphere, originated from domains (1200-1400 CE) following the downfall of Tiwanaku (1000-1100 CE), with possible links to the Wari culture (500-1000 CE) ([Trekkingchile - Aymara](https://www.trekkingchile.com/en/chile-info/aymara/)). They engaged in agriculture, herding llamas and alpacas, and lived in extended family units, maintaining their linguistic and ethnic identity in the foothills and high plains due to Spanish pressure. The Atacameños, or Licanantay, had settlements dating back over 6,000 years, with evidence from 10,000 years ago, adapting to the desert with oases agriculture and developing ceramic crafts, copper work (using Chuquicamata copper), and gold work ([Atacama people - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_people)). They built fortified villages called pukaras and had significant settlements like San Pedro de Atacama, interacting with the Inca Empire through road construction.

#### Central and Southern Cultures
Central and southern Chile were dominated by agro-pottery cultures, precursors to the Mapuche. The Pitrén culture (100-1100 CE), located between the Bío Bío River and Lake Llanquihue, was the first horticultural society in the region, growing potatoes and maize, and relying on gathering wild fruits like piñón (Araucaria nuts) and hunting guanacos and deer ([Chile Precolombino - Pitrén](https://chileprecolombino.cl/en/prehistoria/culturas/sur/pitren/historia/)). Their pottery, the oldest in the region, featured monochromatic surfaces and molded decorations, including animal-shaped jugs and the Ketru Metawe or "duck-shaped jug," still used by Mapuche today. The El Vergel culture (1100-1500 CE), succeeding Pitrén, showed Andean influences in ceramics and metalwork, cultivating crops like quinoa and maintaining small family-based settlements with complex burial practices, including urn burials and shamanistic rituals involving hallucinogenic substances ([Chile Precolombino - El Vergel](https://chileprecolombino.cl/en/prehistoria/culturas/sur/el-vergel/historia/)).

The Mapuche, considered direct descendants of Pitrén and El Vergel, were a significant presence by the 16th century, with Mapudungun spoken from the Choapa River to Chiloé. They resisted Inca subjugation, maintaining a decentralized society of family clans, and were known for their warrior culture, which would later challenge Spanish colonization ([Mapuche history - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche_history)). Their cultural identity was strengthened by interactions with neighboring groups, possibly in response to external pressures.

| **Culture**   | **Period (CE)** | **Region**                     | **Key Features**                     |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Pitrén        | 100-1100        | Bío Bío to Llanquihue         | First horticulturists, early pottery |
| El Vergel     | 1100-1500       | Araucania region               | Andean influences, complex burials   |
| Mapuche       | Pre-16th century| Central to southern Chile      | Warrior culture, resistance to Incas |

#### Far Southern Tribes
The far south, encompassing Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, was inhabited by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes adapted to harsh conditions. The Selk'nam, or Ona, lived in northeastern Tierra del Fuego, with a history stretching back thousands of years, subsisting on guanaco hunting, fishing, and gathering, and constructing temporary shelters from natural materials ([Selk'nam people - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selk%27nam_people)). They had distinct gender roles, with men handling hunting and spiritual leadership, and women managing domestic tasks. The Kawésqar (Alacalufes) and Yaghan, also nomadic, navigated the southern islands, relying on marine resources and maintaining unique cultural practices, including elaborate rituals.

These groups, though less documented due to their nomadic lifestyle, had rich oral traditions and were among the last indigenous peoples in South America to encounter Europeans, facing significant challenges with colonization ([Americas Quarterly - Indigenous Resistance](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/when-chiles-indigenous-made-the-spanish-back-down/)).

#### Conclusion
Chile's pre-colonial history reflects a mosaic of indigenous cultures, each with distinct adaptations to their environments. From the early settlers at Monte Verde to the complex societies of the Chinchorro, Aymara, Atacameños, Mapuche, and southern nomads, these groups contributed to a diverse cultural heritage, shaping the region's identity before the arrival of the Spanish.
